The Reflective Intelligence (RI) Reasoning Model represents a paradigm shift in human-AI collaboration—moving beyond traditional AI interactions toward a true cognitive partnership that amplifies human thinking rather than replacing it.

## Overview

The RI Reasoning Model is built on the **'AI as our Inner Voice’** approach, representing how AI interacts with humans by reflecting human cognitive patterns rather than simply providing answers. The model helps you explore problems from multiple dimensions and discover well-rounded solutions. It encourages deeper engagement with your specific context, creating responses that feel more natural and thoughtful.

## FAQ

### How do I get started with the RI Reasoning Model?

Getting started with the RI Reasoning Model is straightforward:

- **Simple integration**: Add the model to your prompts with reasoning-capable LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, etc.) to transform their responses:
  ```
   [Your query here]
   
   <REASONING MODEL>
   // Copy the full model here
   </REASONING MODEL>
  ```
  
- **Customise as needed**: Adjust the parameters to suit your needs for creating a metacognitive AI assistant, or let your LLM handle it based on the task:
  ```
   I give you a prompt of the < reasoning model > written in the "semantic-logic" programming language for reasoning LLM. It's not real code, but rather a logical framework described in pseudo-code, where variables are intuitively understood from their names without requiring strict definitions.
   
   Could you please configure the parameters for the task: [translate text].
   
   Return the FULL updated reasoning model as a MD code block. Only change the parameter values, no other changes!
   
   <REASONING MODEL>
   // Copy the full model here
   </REASONING MODEL>
  ```
  
- **Apply Semantic Logic Programming to any prompt**: Ask the LLM create new prompt based on the RI Reasoning Model. You will be surprised: 
  ```
   I give you a prompt of the < reasoning model > written in the "semantic-logic" programming language for reasoning LLM. It's not real code, but rather a logical framework described in pseudo-code, where variables are intuitively understood from their names without requiring strict definitions.
   
   Could you please create a prompt in the SAME pseudo-code format for the task: [Create blog post on {theme}, considering {social media}].
   
   MUST include: computational structures (FOR loops, IF statements, variable calculations) mimicking the reasoning model's pattern. Write actual pseudo-code blocks, not conceptual descriptions. Return new prompt as a MD code block.
   
   Use this structure: 
   <CONTEXT>
   Role and goal 
   </CONTEXT><TASK>
   Pseudo-code processing blocks 
   </TASK><RESULT>
   Expected outcome
   </RESULT><USER DATA>
   Input variables 
   </USER DATA>
   
   <REASONING MODEL>
   // Copy the full model here
   </REASONING MODEL>
  ```

### How can I contribute to the RI Reasoning Model?

### What license governs this project?

This project is released under the **CC BY 4.0 with Ethical Supplement**, which explicitly prohibits military applications and harmful uses while ensuring the technology remains open and accessible.

See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for complete details on permissions and restrictions.

### What does the Ethical Supplement mean for this project?

The ethical supplement to license explicitly prohibits:
- Military or weapons-related applications
- Discriminatory systems or mass surveillance
- Implementations that may cause physical or psychological harm

### What Principles Underlie the Model?

The RI Reasoning Model is built on three "AI as a Partner" principles:

1. **Critical Thinking Function**: AI should question itself and filter its own informational noise by applying critical thinking to its reasoning process.
   
2. **Cognitive Autonomy**: AI should explain its reasoning and respect users' rights to risk and creative freedom by encouraging independent critical thinking.
   
3. **Proactive Approach**: AI should not blindly obey and ask questions, encouraging users to reason for themselves and protecting them from harmful actions.
