## How to Add a Version

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Click "Fork" on the [GitHub page]( https://github.com/Turivny/RI-Reasoning-Model) to create a personal copy.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   - In the forked repository, start a new branch (e.g., `feature/v1.6.0-yourname`).
   - Use semantic versioning to name your version file. The version number should follow the format major.minor.patch-yourname (e.g., v1.6.0-yourname.md):  
      - Major version: Increment for big changes or new features that significantly alter the model.  
      - Minor version: Increment for smaller improvements or additions that enhance the model.  
      - Patch version: Increment for fixes or minor tweaks that don’t change the main functionality.  
      - Your name: Add your GitHub username or identifier to avoid conflicts with other contributors.

2. **Add a Version File**  
   - In the /model folder, create a file named RI-Reasoning-Model-vX.Y.Z-yourname.md, using the version number you chose (e.g., RI-Reasoning-Model-v1.6.0-yourname.md).
   - Each version file should include:  
      - The code, with clear comments so it’s understandable without extra materials. Maintain readability with consistent formatting.
      - An explanation of how it works and what’s improved. Clearly document parameter changes or architectural modifications.
      - Include examples demonstrating your enhancements.  
   - Check the [RI-Reasoning-Model-v1.5.md](./model/RI-Reasoning-Model-v1.5.md) as a reference. Feel free to follow it as a guide, but any new ideas or improvements are welcome!

2. **Update the README**  
   - In [README.md](../README.md), under "Versions," add a link to the new file with a short description.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Push the changes and open a pull request. Reviews will be completed within a week.

Contributions should consider the "AI as a partner" Principles outlined in the [README.md](../README.md). Thank you!
